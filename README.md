# 3D-Printed-PLA-High-Voltage-Capacitor
A 3d printed high voltage planar capacitor. Printed with FDM type 3d printer. PLA and ABS filament was used. The capacitor goes up to 50 Hz, 50 kV 20 Ampere without fault and electrical breakdown. The power of the transformer that was used to power the capicator was not enough to make further tests. The printed capacitor was not cherry-picked. The first capacitor ever produced as a prototype was tested. It was concluded that the planar capacitor design printed with PLA is fault-tolerant and durable. The measurement results are included in the thesis as a table.  
aka "Corn made doomsday high voltage capacitor".

For the experiments, a 2.5 nF high voltage capacitor with a rated voltage of 30 kV was designed. For the geometry of the capacitor, planar capacitor geometry was chosen to improve the manufacturing quality of the FDM printer. In this way, it is aimed to reduce possible errors in the production of the capacitor as much as possible. Planar capacitor design was drawn with computer-aided 3D drawing program. The dimensions of the 2.5 nF capacitor design were determined according to the printing settings of the three-dimensional printer. By simplifying the production process according to the capabilities of the 3d printer, the designs were successfully produced in values close to the designed dimensions. In order to measure the electrical properties of the printing materials which are also the dielectric materials of the capacitors and discs with a diameter of 5 cm were produced in different thickness. ABS and PLA materials are used in the production of capacitors and discs. Powdered iron shawing were used as conductors in the capacitor.

"Corn ?" (⊙.☉) --> [*"PLA has become a popular material due to it being economically produced from renewable resources. In 2010, PLA had the second highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world,[3] although it is still not a commodity polymer. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings.[4] PLA is the most widely used plastic filament material in 3D printing."*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid)
